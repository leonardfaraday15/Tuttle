curtain.blend in parts

The curtains included in parts are fairly uniform looking, and small. You would first want to use an array to multiply to proper size.
Then you would want to make minor alterations with pef turned on. The subdivision modifier is present,but not yet applied.

theater curtains are 3m high and extend from the back only 7cm
