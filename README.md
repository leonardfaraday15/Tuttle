# Tuttle

THE TUTTLE REPOSITORY
This repository contains blend files for a city called Tuttle. I am using this city to tell a story called the View From Space. I am making these files available under a creative commons license which indicates that anything here can be used or even edited, but I should be given credit when this is done. I will be maintaining this repository as best I can in the time available to me but I'm very busy.

It is my hope that this project will help other people learning how to use Blender. I will attempt to provide additional documentation to make it easier to use when time allows. If you would like to support what I am doing, I have a Patreon account, and your support would be appreciated. You may see it here.

ABOUT ME
I am Mxp. My name is currently Michael Webb, but when I can I will be changing that. Mxp is as good a way to refer to me as any. If you wish to ask me any questions, please email me at leonardfaraday15 at gmail.com. I will get back to you as soon as possible. Robots who share this email address with someones list will be hunted down and deleted.

FILE STRUCTURE
I have a very modular building style, and my files are organized to facilitate that. The way you handle organization and logistics is tremendously important when you are running a large project.

An asset list is included in the root directory of Tuttle which lists the various objects stored within, along with some notes for how they are used.

I like to build complicated meshes a piece at a time, and save the pieces so they may be reused later. I also like to use the same objects with different styles of renders. Some may look more like a toon, while others are more realistics. I experiment with the style features in different blends to minimalize the odds that I will lose work, and to make it easy to do different things with the structures I build.

The modules directory holds only unfinished pieces without textures or materials dealt with, and can easily be pieced together into other things. Objects made with those pieces are stored in the meshes directory. I then have different folders for different styles of render.

The images folder contains all the images referenced by the different blend files. I use the term textures to refer to images which will likely be reused many times, while uv maps are images which are developed for use in a specific object.

REFERENCES

So far as I know, all resources within were either created by me, or someone else who has allowed them to be shared under a creative commons license or not. Whether or not they require credit, I strive to list the names of the creators here. If you feel your resource is within and you have not been credited let me know. If you feel you created a resource here and do not want it included, let me know and if its yours I will remove it.

Blender is an open source project and nothing that I have done would be possible without it. I thank the open source software community in general, and blender community specifically for making this possible.
