This is male base v1. It began as basemesh provided by another user below. It has far more vertexes in the head area
then elsewhere. This is entirely by design, as I'm going to try to make them express complicated emotions.

Also provided is a pitchipoy metarig which has already been edited pretty close to the shape of this model.
The pitchipoy version allows control of the face. It's somewhat more complicated, but I'm going to include
documentation to allow users to walk through the process.

I have included cut out pieces of the mesh, including hands, arms, and legs, becuase I make people in modern
clothing, and frequently I need parts of the same mesh to combine with clothing. A man wearing a short
sleeved shirt could use the bust of the head, and the arms and hands, along with a shirt, pants, socks,
and shoes.
